# Tic Tac Toe

Tic Tac Toe is a classic board game implemented in Python. The game allows the player to play against an AI opponent. The player can choose their character ('X' or 'O'), and the goal is to get three of their characters in a row, column, or diagonal on the game board. The AI opponent uses simple logic to make its moves.

## Usage

- Enter the position on the board to make your move (0-8).
- The AI opponent will make its move.
- The game ends when a player wins, there is a draw, or the user chooses to quit.
- Play again or quit at the end of the game.
